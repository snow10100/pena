"""
    Here is an empty file to make api as package, you can see there is one folder and one file:
    - schemas/
    - routes.py

    The main purpose of schemas folder is simple: Give formal validation for the requests/responses
    you can see inside schemas/ folder there are two files:
    - request.py
    - response.py

    Each one will model either the request or the response to be used in routes.py
    let us jump to schemas folder specifically to request.py
