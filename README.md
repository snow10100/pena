## installation

I recommend creating a virtual environment using 

```console
python -m venv . 
```

then install the required libraries, make sure to install that chat model you prefer, you can uncomment lines inside the requirements file or add your own. 

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run the code 
you can run the code using 
```console
python main.py
```
